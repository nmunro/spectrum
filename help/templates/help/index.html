      <p>Selby Town Primary Care Network organised a meeting in July 2023 with a view to bringing
interested stakeholders together to help to promote awareness of neurodiversity in the Selby
District. They had previously carried out a survey on existing provision and discovered that were was
very little provision for in the district for people living with neurodiversity. The group aims to provide
help to organisations / groups looking to set up events and resources that will help people living with
neurodiversity and as part of this provision were keen to produce a directory of neurodiversity
provision in the district.</p>

      <p>A local charity called Spirit of Christmas offered to put a directory together of existing provision in
the district from information provided by other organisations attending the meeting. However, the
charity had a volunteer who specialises in code writing for computer programmes and this volunteer
put together a small team who would develop an online resource where individuals could search for
resources / events in their locality and where groups / organisations could promote what they do.
If you are reading this introduction, then you are looking to promote resources or activities that will
be of interest to people living with neurodiversity.</p>

      <p>Thank you for signing up to promote what you do. It is hoped that as the site grows it will help to
provide the general public with details of what is happening in their locality with regards to
neurodivergent provision.</p>
